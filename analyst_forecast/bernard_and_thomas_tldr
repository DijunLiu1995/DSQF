1. Introduction
	1a. Long(short) top(bottom) 10% of unexpected decile stocks, 60 days after earnnings, return 25% annualized before t-cost

	FOS - prior paper on PEAD

2. PEAD - Nature of phenomenon
	2a. earnings / (std prior forecast error), compared to XS dist of scaled unexpected returns.
	2b. 120 day timeseries plot +-60 based around 0 earnings

2.1 The case for CAPM
	2.1a Beta shift up(down) for good(bad) earnings surprise
		2.1a1 Does beta * mkt explain?

2.2 The case for delayed response
	

3.1 Sample selection
	NYSE AMEX 1974-1986
	NASDAQ 1975-1985
3.2 Estimation Procedure
	Banz-Reinganum size effect (?) controls
	AR_j_t = R_j_t - R_p_t

	AR_j_t = abnormal returns for firm j @ t
	 R_j_t =            "      "   "   " " "
	 R_p_t = Equal weigthed mkt cap decile returns on respective exchange	

	Paper sums returns rather than cum growth.

3.2.2 They use "Foster model" (?)	
	- SUE - standardized unexpected earnings
	- seems like some box-jenkins-y AR1 thing. need to poke around.
		- see if teammates know.

3.2.3 Portfolio assignment without lookahead - good.

3.2.4 Equal dollar long and short of portfolios that report good and bad news.
	- Good or bad is against prior quarter earnings distribution
	- Portfolio then compounded 60 days.
	- Positions are not taken until there is a long and short position to offset (weird methodology)
		- Stocks are broken up into small/medium/large

4.1 Most drift occurs within 5 days of earnings.	

... Other stuff based on results. Can get there when we have results.
